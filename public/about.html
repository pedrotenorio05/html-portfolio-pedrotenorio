<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, my name is Pedro Tenório, and I am a Computer Science student at the Federal Rural University of Pernambuco. 
  I am currently focusing on web development, with the goal of mastering this area and building a strong foundation 
  for my future career. Technology has always fascinated me, and I see it as a powerful tool to solve problems and 
  create meaningful solutions.</p>

<p>I live in Recife, Brazil, and outside of my studies I enjoy reading books, traveling, writing poems, and watching 
  movies. These hobbies help me stay creative and curious, both qualities that I believe are essential for a developer. 
  I also have the dream of living abroad, either in Europe or the United States, where I can continue to grow personally
  and professionally.</p>

<p>In the future, I plan to specialize in artificial intelligence and apply my knowledge of computing to projects that
  improve people’s quality of life. I am motivated by the idea of combining innovation and social impact, and I want
  my work to make a difference not only in the tech industry but also in the everyday lives of others.</p>
